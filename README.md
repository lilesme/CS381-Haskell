# CS381-Haskell
Contains all the assignments I submitted for the course CS 381 - Programming Language Fundamentals. 

The objectives for the course are as follows:

* Create functional programs using algebraic data types and recursive functions.

* Produce and explain the type and result of an expression in the context of functional programming.

* Produce an abstract syntax for a language given its concrete syntax.

* Create a denotational semantics for a language given its abstract syntax and an informal specification of its behavior.

* Produce and explain the behavior of a program under static vs. dynamic typing, and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each approach.

* Produce and explain a program’s output under static vs. dynamic scoping of names.

* Produce and explain a program’s output under different parameter passing schemes, such as call-by-value vs. call-by-name vs. call-by-need.

* Create logic programs and express queries using predicates.
